# BetterStat
The better, more flexible thermostat.
A project summary as well as some introductory documentation will be put here soon. It's just a matter of time. Please note that this project hasn't even had its first unstable release yet. With the three main codebases under rapid development, the majority of the more recent changes have not made it to the `master` branch and remain in the `develop` branches. If you intend to poke through the code, you should make sure to check the `develop` branch of these submodules.
